== Libraries under private

[IMPORTANT]
----
Libraries under private will not be tagged or maintained for public consumption (at least initially).
They are not internal because I still reserve the right to import them in other personal projects.
----

link:private/hclutils[] - Package hclutils provides utilities to work with custom DSLs based on HCL.
