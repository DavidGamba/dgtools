== Config file syntax

The config file is a CUE file with the following syntax:

[source, cue]
----
package tz

default_group: "name"

group: "name": {
	member: "name": {city: "city", admin1: "admin1", country_code: "country_code", time_zone: "time_zone"}
}
----

The `admin1` field is the Admin division 1 name as defined in the geonames database: state, province, etc.

You can create reusable cities, for example:

[source, cue]
----
_miami: {city: "Miami", admin1: "Florida", country_code: "US"}

group: "family": {
	member: "Brother": _miami
}
----

Not all fields are required, as long as the provided fields uniquely identify a city or a time zone.

Additionally, members can be labeled as `type: "city"` or `type: "country"` so they show up before other members (`type: "person"` by default).

[source, cue]
----
member: "Palo_Alto": _palo_alto
member: "Palo_Alto": {type: "city"}
----

== Installation

Install using go:

----
go install github.com/DavidGamba/dgtools/tz@latest
----

Ensure your Go bin is in your PATH, then add the following to your `.bashrc` file for completion:

----
complete -o default -C tz tz
----

== Features

* Show the time zone of your team members.

* Show countries and cities in the same view as people but show them first for a faster lookup.

* Use a config file to configure your time zone groups.

* List all time zones by city so you can easily edit your config file.

* Show the day next to the time to see -1/+1 days.

== Motivation

Replacement for my `date` based https://github.com/DavidGamba/bin/blob/96468fe1ebfdc81972dad0b56a11b8023f3f639b/tz[tz] script.

== City time zone information

Information obtained by going to http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and downloading the `cities15000.zip` file.

Then a sqlite3 db is generated using the command:

----
sqlite3 cities.db < db.schema
----

Finally, the following query is used to generate an export:

----
sqlite3 cities.db ".headers off" ".mode tabs" "select distinct c.asciiname,a.asciiname,c.countrycode,c.timezone,c.population from cities as c left join admin1 as a on c.countrycode || '.' || c.admin1code = a.code;"  > cities-tz.tsv
----

The TSV is bundled in the binary (The resulting TSV is smaller than its CSV and JSON counterparts).

== ROADMAP

* Show google maps link to city

* tz list shows a list of all timezone abbreviations

* admin1 filter in cities list
