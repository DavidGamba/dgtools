== How it works

Prints your env vars but hides the values of any of the keys or values that match `key`, `password` or `token`.

It also hides values that start with known secret prefixes: `sk-`, `ghp_`.

Finally, it calculates the value's entropy using Shannon's entropy formula and hides anything that passes the default threshold of 4.0 bits.

There is a list of known safe Env vars that are not checked, for example `PATH`.
